 * Chart palette. Validated with the dataviz validator against the light
 * surface — do not substitute by eye:
 *
 *   accent vs deemphasis: CVD ΔE 8.5 (deutan), normal-vision ΔE 22.6,
 *   both ≥ 3:1 contrast on surface.
 *
 * `deemphasis` is intentionally a gray: this is the emphasis pattern, where
 * "replied" is the story and "pending" is context. It is not a categorical
 * identity slot, so the chroma floor does not apply to it.
